# KygekRulesUI

A plugin that will show your server rules in UI form. To open KygekRulesUI, simply type `/rules` in the chat.

# Features

- Easy to use (you can set the `title`, `content` and `button` in the `config.yml`)
- No need to restart, config will automatically get reloaded every time the `/rules` command gets executed!
- Use `{player}` to display player name
- Use `ยง` as formatting codes
- Use `\n` to break into a new line
- FormAPI plugin is not required

# How to Install

1. Download the latest version (It is recommended to always download the latest version for the best experience, except you're having compatibility issues).
2. Put the .phar file to the `plugins` folder.
3. Restart the server.
4. Open the `config.yml` file in the `plugin_data/KygekRulesUI` folder to edit the `title`, `content` and `button` (NEVER TOUCH THE `config-version`!).
5. Join the server and type `/rules` in the player chat.
6. Done!

# Commands & Permissions

- Command: `/rules` (Change command feature will be available soon!)
- Permission: `rules.command` (Default set to `true`, use `-rules.command` in PurePerms to blacklist the permission)
